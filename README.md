- **Content Summarization**: Extracts key points and insights
- **Custom Prompts**: Configurable prompts for specific analysis needs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Node.js and npm installed
- AWS CDK installed
- Python 3.8+ installed
- API keys for external services (Lemonfox.ai, Llama4Scout)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure API keys in `cfg.py`:
   - Set your Lemonfox.ai API key
   - Configure Llama4Scout endpoint
   - Set HuggingFace token if needed

4. Configure AWS credentials
5. Deploy the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   cdk deploy --all
   ```

### Usage
